<h1>About Me</h1>
<h1>The world is rotten with outdated, inefficient code. I am here to fix it.</h1>
        
        <p>I am <strong>Light Yagami</strong>, a highly skilled and detail-obsessed web developer with a vision: to create a flawless, optimized, and perfectly structured digital world. Just as a superior intellect must guide society, clean and efficient code must guide the web.</p>

        <p>With an analytical mind and a relentless drive for perfection, I craft web experiences that are fast, intuitive, and impossible to break. Every project is a calculated move—precision, logic, and efficiency drive my work. Whether it's a sleek UI or a robust backend, I leave no vulnerabilities. Weak design and unstructured code have no place in my domain.</p>

        <p>And when faced with a challenge, I won’t just solve it.</p>

        <h2>I will take a messy, unoptimized codebase… AND REFACTOR IT!</h2>

        <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimization is justice – I write clean, scalable code that stands the test of time.</li>
            <li>User experience is control – A well-crafted UI should feel inevitable, guiding users effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Security is absolute – I eliminate bugs and loopholes like they never existed.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I don’t just develop websites—I architect digital dominance.</p>
